 5. Register user
auth.py contains the following updates:

Implement the Auth.register_user in the Auth class provided.

 6. Basic Flask app
app.py contains a basic Flask app with the following requirements:

Create a Flask app that has a single GET route ("/") and use flask.jsonify to return a JSON payload.

 7. Register user
app.py contains the following updates:

Implement the end-point to register a user. Define a users function that implements the POST /users route.

auth.py contains the following updates:

Implement the Auth.valid_login method. It should expect email and password required arguments and return a boolean.

 9. Generate UUIDs
auth.py contains the following updates:

Implement a _generate_uuid function in the auth module. The function should return a string representation of a new UUID. Use the uuid module.

 10. Get session ID
auth.py contains the following updates:

Implement the Auth.create_session method. It takes an email string argument and returns the session ID as a string.

  11. Log in
app.py contains the following updates:

Implement a login function to respond to the POST /sessions route.

Implement the Auth.get_user_from_session_id method. It takes a single session_id string argument and returns the corresponding User or None.

 13. Destroy session
auth.py contains the following updates:

Implement Auth.destroy_session. The method takes a single user_id integer argument and returns None.

 14. Log out

Implement a logout function to respond to the DELETE /sessions route.

 15. User profile
app.py contains the following updates:

Implement a profile function to respond to the GET /profile route.

 16. Generate reset password token

Implement the Auth.get_reset_password_token method. It takes an email string argument and returns a string.

 17. Get reset password token
app.py contains the following updates:

Implement a get_reset_password_token function to respond to the POST /reset_password route.

 18. Update password

Implement the Auth.update_password method. It takes reset_token string argument and a password string argument and returns None.

 19. Update password end-point
app.py contains the following updates:

Implement the update_password function in the app module to respond to the PUT /reset_password route.

 20. End-to-end integration test

Start the Flask app you created in the previous tasks. Open a new terminal window.
